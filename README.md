## üìö Research

I'm currently researching Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) using machine learning methodologies, focusing on classifying silent speech from brain activity.

## üåü Projects

- [Brain-Computer Interface]: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354583">Decode Brain Signal Into Thai Word Using EEG and L-SVM</a>
- [Digital Submersible Pump Control Timer]: After running the pump this device help to turn the pump off and save from tank overflow.
- [Drone Development]: Worked on developing a delivery drone with and without GPS capabilities.
- [Digital Fluid Measurement System]: Created a system utilizing a mini pump for precise measurements.
- [Automatic Relief Distribution System]: Developed a system with vending facilities and supervised machine learning.
